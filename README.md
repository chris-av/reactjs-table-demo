# React Table Demo

This demo was inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/6s0OVdoo4Q4) video that mocked a possible intermediate, ReactJS interview. I wanted to do my own implementation of a ReactJS table that can sort by column. 

The idea that occurred for me was to create a very simple array structure that could be easily iterated over. I did not dynamically pluck out the variables form the API, I actually hardcoded them because it made more sense that way given the way the question was framed. 

In addition, I wanted to use generator functions to cycle through the ascending, descending and default row ordering. I found it to be incredibly useful.
